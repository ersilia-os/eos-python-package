# My Ersilia Python Package

Template repository for an Ersilia Python package.

This package provides a foundation for developing and distributing Python tools within the Ersilia ecosystem. It is designed to help researchers and developers quickly set up, share, and maintain reproducible code for AI/ML models, particularly in the context of antimicrobial drug discovery. The motivation behind this package is to streamline collaboration, ensure best practices, and accelerate scientific progress by making robust, well-documented Python packages easily accessible to the community.

## Installation

To get started, create a Conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n my_env python=3.12
conda activate my_env
```

Then install the package using pip:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ersilia-os/my-ersilia-python-package.git
```

## Usage

Provide an end-to-end usage example. All data should be included in the repository for reproducibility.

Example:

```python
from my_package.core import hello

hello("Ersilia")
```

This prints `"Hello, Ersilia!"` in the Python terminal.

## About the Ersilia Open Source Initiative
