# My Ersilia Python Package
Template respository for an Ersilia Python package

Write a 100-word description of the package, explaining the purpose and motivation.

## Installation

Give detailed installation instructions. Use code snippets as necessary.

Typically, you want to start by creating a Conda environment:

```bash
conda create -n my_env python=3.12
conda activate my_env
```

Then, you install the package, for example, with Pip by using the GitHub repository link:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ersilia-os/my-ersilia-python-package.git
```

## Usage

Always provide and end-to-end usage example. This example should be reproducible and the data should be contained within the repository itself.

Here is the code snippet for an example:

```python
from my_package.core import hello

hello("Ersilia")
```

This will print the string `"Hello, Ersilia!"` into the Python terminal.
